This is my modified version of aprsd 2.1.2 to support Linux AX.25
sockets. See aprsd.conf for how to configure it. You need libax25
and header files installed to compile in the sockets code; you
can compile aprsd without them though if you just need TNC support.

It also has wildcard support for the gate2rf and posit2rf functions.
HOWEVER, you cannot specify just a '*' to gate all traffic -- you must
specify at least one character. A suitable use might be VK3SB* for all
of my SSIDs. So V* is allowed, but just * is not. If you want to gate
all the traffic, you can modify the source to allow it (not too
difficult), or twist my arm.
