	I have taken Dale's latest source (2.1.5x) and made some heavy mods
	and code clean-ups.

	-  Integrated mutex class.  This class eliviates the problem of
	   hung locks as all locks are locally defined and expire when they 
	   are out of scope.
	-  Integrated exception class.  This is a drop in replacement for
	   the gnu class and is doing little more than the replacing the 
	   the current lib version... for now anyway.
	-  Reconfigured package to use AutoTools for configuration and make.
	-  Removed references to STLport.  Using gnu gcc >= 3.1 should preclude
	   the use of this library as it is supposed to be "thread-safe".  
	   I may re-enable this as a configure option at a later time.
	-  Minor mods to the httpserver pages - mostly cosmetic.
	-  Added ConvertUpTime() to servers.cpp which takes the server uptime, 
	   in seconds, and converts it into a more meaningful value.  This is 
	   used in console status output and html status pages.
