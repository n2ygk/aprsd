<H2>WA4DSY Linux APRS server docs. 2.1.4 Aug 19  2000</H2>

<h3>Notes for 2.1.4</h3>
Version 2.1.4 fixes some minor bugs and adds some functionality.  See the <a href="#Revisions"> Revisions </a> section
for more details on the changes. The main enhancement is you have a choice of converting MIC-E
packets to classic APRS packets or not.  The default is to NOT convert them.  The new command
"ConvertMicE yes | no" should be placed in your /home/aprsd2/aprsd.conf file.


<h3>Notes for 2.1.3 and 2.1.2</h3>
This upgrade adds three keywords to the aprsd.conf file.<br>
<pre>
httpport 14501
ipwatchport 14502
hub domain.name port [user  pass]
</pre>
The first two, httpport and ipwatchport, will be enabled by default even if you don't add them to aprsd.conf.
If you want different ports or want to disable these features will you need to
edit the config file.
Documentation on these can be found in <a href="ports.html"> ports.html</a><br>
Please read the <a href="#Revisions"> Revisions </a> section. 
<p>
The httpport (14501) port suppiles server status information in HTML format. 
This port is accessed with any web browser by entering the
URL: <A HREF="http://wa4dsy.net:14501/"> http://wa4dsy.net:14501/ </A>
  (replace "wa4dsy.net" with the domain name of the
aprsd server you want ) To refresh the data click the RELOAD button on your browser.

<p>
The ipwatchport (14502) provides all data streams without dup filtering with
a special header prepended. The header contains the source IP address of the
packet and the user login name, "IGATE" or "UDP".  An example: !44.36.16.48:WA4DSY!
Packets from other igates this server connected to will show the domain name
instead of the IP address and the user will be "IGATE".  Packets from the UDP port
will have the IP address and the user field will be "UDP".  Packets from the TNC
will have "TNC" in the IP address field and "*" in the user field .
Use telnet or nc optionally with grep to determine the source of packets.  <br>
eg: telnet first.aprs.net 23 | grep '199.45.66.88' <br>
Will display only packets from IP address 199.45.66.88.

<p>

The new "hub" command is used like the "igate" command.  The syntax is the same.
Unlike "igate" only <em> one </em> hub will be active at any time.  If the hub connection
fails aprsd will try to connect to the next hub listed and if that fails, the next and so on.
<p>


Everyone: You will need to compile the code get a working
executable for your system. This is done automatically by the install script.
Be advised you need the c++ compiler installed on your system.
You can also type "make" to compile the program.
It is designed to work on RedHat 5.1 and later
Linux distributions.  This includes Mandrake. Others may or may not work.
Early versions before 5.1 will not work.

Go the the <a href="#daemon"> Installing </a> for more details.

<a name="Revisions"> 

<H3>REVISION 2.1.4 <br>
Aug 2000</H3>
<ul>
<li>  Fixed DeleteSession() so it can't delete if port number is -1
    and made ConnectedClients a signed integer. Hopefully this will
    prevent errors in the user count.
    
<li> The dup detector now ignores trailing spaces at end of packet.

<li> Put Location info on the html status page
<li> Deal with mic-e timestamps as per this email from Bob on Aug 3 2000.
   <pre>
   "We should not have included the timestamp when the conversion was done by
   an IGate just for the reasons that we dropped the time stamp in all other
   stations back in 1996. 

   It was a mistake and we should fix it by simply replacing the "@DDHHMMz"
   portion of the conversion with a "!" for TAPR Mic-E's  and to a "="
   format for Message capable Mic-E's (Kenwoods).  This would eliminate this
   nuisance immediately. "
   </pre>

<li> Fixed bug in HUB connection logic that caused it to advance by two instead of one
   after attempting to connect to a hub that was down.  If only 2 hubs were defined
   it would always retry the same dead hub over and over.
   
<li> Added command "LogAllRF" to aprsd.conf.  When set to "yes" all packets heard from the TNC
   will be written to /home/aprsd2/rf.log instead of only packets with our call sign as was the case.
   
   
<li> Added keyword "ConvertMicE yes | no" to aprsd.conf file.  If this is set to "yes"
   Mic-E packets will be converted to classic APRS packets, otherwise they will pass
   through unchanged.
   
<li> Cleaned up some code in history.cpp: createHistoryArray(aprsString* hp) so it now
   cleanly aborts a history dump if memory allocation fails.  The original code ignored a malloc failure.

   
</ul>
<p>




<H3>REVISION 2.1.3 <br>
July 6 2000</H3>
<ul>
<li> Fixed bug in user counter that incremented each time
a hub connection was restablished and outgoing data was enabled, eg: a user and pass code provided.
This bug caused the user limit to be exceeded even though there were not really that many users.
</ul>
<p>
<h3>REVISION 2.1.2 <br> May-June 2000</h3>
<ul>
<li>  Fixed lots of problems in the Mic-e conversion routine.<br>  
     It now conforms to the APRS PROTOCOL REFERENCE 1.0 <br>
     Conversion errors should be gone now! 
<li>  Changed packet buffers size from 1024 bytes to 255 bytes
     This can be changed to larger values if desired by editing the
     "#define BUFSIZE 255" line in  constant.h and recompiling.
     Incoming lines longer than  BUFSIZE will be truncated.  The
     size includes CR, LF and NULL at the end of the line.                                  
<li>  Added a filter in SendToAllClients() to remove 3rd party <em>reformatted</em> packets from <em>Internet</em> data stream 
<li>  Raised the igate limit from 20 to 100
<li>  Fixed error in serverConfig() that allowed more igates to be defined than buffer size permitted                                                       
<li>  Added "MSTAMP OFF" to TNC.INIT file 
<li>  "# Tickle" is removed.
<li>  Added http server to provide status information in HTML format on port 14501 (or user defined)
<li>  Added keyword for aprsd.conf file to support http server configuration: httpport <port number>
    To change the port number add to your aprsd.conf file: httpport nnnnn  where "nnnnn" is the port number.
    To DISABLE this feature add this to your aprsd.conf file: httpport 0
<li>  Fixed bug in SendToAllClients() which failed to close the socket when user disappeared.
<li> Filter out comment packets, eg: # Tickle, at the igate and user inputs so they aren't repeated.

<li> Added keyword for aprsd.conf to support a data port suppling the source IP address prepended
    to each aprs packet.  eg: If user w4xyz at IP address 192.168.1.2 sends "Hi There." the
    packet will be sent out as: "!192.168.1.2:w4xyz!Hi There." This can help locate the source of bogus packets.
    To change the port number add to your aprsd.conf file: ipwatchport nnnnn  where "nnnnn" is the port number.
    To DISABLE this feature add this to your aprsd.conf file: ipwatchport 0
    
    
<li> Fixed end-of-line logic so it accepts CR or LF or CR-LF or LF-CR on
    all incoming internet packets. Now we can use netcat (nc) in addition
    to telnet to logon and watch the raw data.
                                                        
<li> Fixed error in code that reads the history.txt file.  Now history items that
    have expired are ignored and don't go into the history list. Time-to-live (ttl)
    variables adjusted for current time.
    
<li> Completely redesigned and recoded the duplicate packet detection logic.
    This effort broke lots of things and several days of debugging were required!
    This version should eliminate 100% of duplicates occuring within 15 seconds.
    See dupCheck.cpp, crc32.c  and  aprsString::gethash().
    
<li> aprsd.conf keyword "igate" now has default values.
<ul>
<li> igate port default is 1313 if not supplied.
<li> igate user default is the value of MyCall if not supplied.
<li> igate pass default is "-1" if not supplied.
<li> Example: "igate first.aprs.net" will expand to "igate first.aprs.net 1313 WA4DSY -1" (assuming your call is WA4DSY)
<li> Note that no data is sent <em> to </em> the igate unless a passcode is supplied.
</ul>
    
<li> Program doesn't Segfault on exit anymore.  It "Terminates" instead.
<li> The MYCALL parameter in the INIT.TNC file is read into the MyCall variable
      in aprsd and overides the MyCall parameter in the aprsd.conf file.  If
      the TNC serial port is not defined the MyCall parameter in aprsd.conf is used.
      Previous versions required you to enter identical MYCALL strings in 
      BOTH aprsd.conf and INIT.TNC.  Now you only need one in INIT.TNC.
      
<li> In INIT.TNC the first parameter to UNPROTO, the ax25 destination address, is
    replaced by the string "APDxxx" where xxx is the verison number of aprsd.
    This is done as the file is read into the TNC with "APDxxx" replacing the
    users string.  eg: UNPROTO APRS VIA WIDE would become UNPROTO APD214 VIA WIDE.
    
<li> History list data is NOT saved to disk every 15 minutes. This is now done only at shutdown.

<li> Cleaned up code so it now compiles without warnings with the -Wall option.
    Added "#define _PTHREADS" and "#define _GNU_SOURCE" to all sources. 
    This should make the STL container library thread safe.

<li> Changed instances of gethostbyname2() to the thread safe version, gethostbyname2_r().
    Also found and changed some other non thread safe fuctions to the safe versions.
    
<li> I fixed a bug in the igate connection thread which resulted in sockets not being
closed after a failed attempt to connect.  This caused aprsd to eventually run out of sockets
if one or more igates were unreachable.  When this happened no more connections could be made.
This bug has been in all previous versions and I believe it has caused most of the "lockup" problems.

<li> Added "hub" keyword to aprsd.conf. This is used the same way as "igate" to define remote
    systems to connect to.  The difference is that although many hubs can be defined only
    one connection will be active at any time. If the connection fails the next hub will be
    tried in rotation until one accepts a connection.  Use "hub" to connect to the "master"
    aprs servers on port 10152 or 23.


</ul>



<p>

<h3>REVISION 2.1.1  <br>4-11-2000</h3>
<ul>
<li> Added "PACLEN 0" to INIT.TNC file to allow 256 byte packets.
<li> Added the validate.cpp module to the open source directory.
<li> Fixed error in AEA to TAPR conversion.  Paths no longer reversed.
<li> Changed default APRServe in aprsd.conf to second.aprs.net.
<li> Updated this documentation file.
<li> Included program "aprspass" to compute aprs passcodes from callsigns.
<li> Fixed bug in ?IGATE? query response so full host name is now displayed.
<li> Install scripts modified to compile source code before installing.
<li> Added keyword "aprsPass &#60yes|no&#62" to aprsd.conf.<br>
  Set to "no" if you don't want to allow logons from users <br>
  with the insecure aprs passcodes.<br>
Set to "yes" if you want the system to work with all users. 
</ul>


<h3>REVISIONS 2.1.0 Pre-Releases 1 to 7<br> 6-20-1999</h3>
<ul>
<li> Fixed the code so it runs properly as a daemon.  
   See added function "daemonInit()" in code.
   Also modified aprsd.init .
   To run as a daemon enter: ./aprsd -d 
   To run as a program enter: ./aprsd <p>
   

<li> Added logic to handle MD5 password encryption in the validate module.
   Now it works with RedHat 6.0 shadowed MD5 passwords.<p>
   
<li> Added "#include &#60errno.h&#62" statements in history.cpp and aprsd.cpp.
   Now it now compiles under RedHat 6.0. <p>
   
<li> Changed logic so messages sent on RF also are sent to other Internet users.
   Needed to do this so messages to wild card groups such as "SCOUTS"
   go both to RF and the remainder of the users and igates. <p>
   
<li> New Feature: The server now responds to the "?IGATE?" query. <p>

<li>New Feature: You can put system abusers in the "user.deny" file and
   deny access to  RF or prevent them from logging on. <p>
   
<li>New Feature: You can configure the server to ignore  packets which were
transmitted from your own TNC.  The previous versions always igated
your own TNCs packets. Use the command line "igateMyCall no" in aprsd.conf
to turn off igateing of your own TNCs packets. <p>
   
<li>Fixed bug that caused the history list dump to abort and disconnect user
   after about 700 items had been sent. <p>
   
<li> Fixed two bugs in aprsString and raw-user send code.  Now mic_e packets
   come out in raw format on port 14580 . <p>
   
<li>Changed the servers status messages to the new format. <br>
    eg: "aprsdATL>APRS,TCPIP*::USERLIST :Verified user W4HAM logged on using MacAPRS 3.2.0."<br>
    Note the extra colon after TCPIP* and the lack of a message number on the end
    to indicate we don't expect an ack. <p>
    
<li>Fixed speed related problem in SendToAllClients() function that caused
    overflows of the Internet send queue.  The server can now handle many
    more users at higher data rates. <p>

 <li>Added command "TncPktSpacing" to the aprsd.conf file. This command takes
    one parameter which is the number of milliseconds between packets sent to the
    TNC.  Queued packets to be transmitted will be spaced out at least by
    this number of milliseconds.  The default is 1500 (1.5 seconds). <p>

<h3>DESCRIPTION </h3>
This is an APRS Internet server program.  It acts as a gateway between
the Internet and a local ham VHF APRS packet network. It is interfaced to
directly to a TNC via one of the PC serial ports and does not use the Linux
ax25 sockets interface. Hamish Moffatt has a 
<a href="http://aprs.moffatt.nu/aprsd.shtml">modified version of aprsd </a>
with ax25 support.<p>

It has only been tested on RedHat Linux 5.1 , 5.2, 6.0 and Mandrake 5.3 and later.  It requires libstdc++ 2.8.0 or later
to run.  It will NOT run on RedHat 4.2. <p>

The program gets data from a TNC connected to a serial port
and sends it to all clients who have connected to any of several user
defined tcp ports. Some defaults are 1313, 10151, 10152 and 14579.	 
It was designed to duplicate most if not all of the functionality of
APRServe, a Macintosh APRS server designed and coded by Steve Dimse, K4HG.<br>
<a href="http://www.aprs.net/aprserve.dcc.html"> See http://www.aprs.net/aprserve.dcc.html</a> <br>
It can also gate data coming from the Internet to the TNC for
transmission on the local VHF RF network.<p>


<h4>CLIENT SOFTWARE</h4>
Users can connect using several client programs such as Mac/WinAPRS,
javAPRS, <a href="http://www.eazy.net/users/fgiannan/linux/"> Xastir for Linux</a>
 and Telnet.  The logon protocol used by Mac/WinAPRS and others is recognized
and properly handled giving registered users the privilige of sending
3rd party messages into the local VHF network. <p>

Clients can use telnet to watch TNC data.<br>
eg: telnet www.wa4dsy.net 14579 <br>
If raw TNC data is desired port 14580 can be used.<p>

Scripts written in languages such as perl can connect to the
server and interact with the data. A UDP port is provided to simplify
injection of data into the aprs stream by scripts. <p>

The system operator can use telnet to monitor the server status
by connecting to any port and enter entering his Linux user name, password
and entering "monitor" for the version field.  Also he can enter remote
sysop mode and gain direct control of the TNC. <br>
eg: user WA4ZZZ pass 12345 vers monitor
<p>


<h4>HISTORY LIST</h4>
A history of data from the TNC and IGATES going back 30 minutes (time also user defined) is kept in
memory and delivered to each user when he connects.  This
history data is filtered to remove duplicates and certain
other unwanted information.  Duplicate data are detected by looking
for any packets with the same data and source call sign that have
been seen in the last 30 seconds. When duplicates are found they are discarded.<p>

There is also a quota system to further reduce the quanity of data in the history list.
Each AX25 source call sign is allowed three packets in the history
list.  One position report, one weather report and one "other".	Only the
most receint of each type is retained. <p>

<h3>INSTALLING AS A DAEMON</h3
<em> (** also see Installing as a Program below **) </em><br>
<ul>
<li>Login as root.

<li>Copy the archive into your home directory.

<li>Issue the following command:

<li>tar zxvf aprsd214.tar.gz

<li>Of course you already did it or you wouldn't be reading this ;-)

<li>cd aprsd214

<LI>Note: The following command will also compile the source files

<li>./INSTALLDAEMON

<li>cd /home/aprsd2

<li>Now make any changes you may require to these files (in /home/aprsd2/): <br>
Note: The install program will not overwrite these if they already exist.
 <ul>   
   <li> aprsd.conf
   <li> user.deny
   <li> welcome.txt
   <li>INIT.TNC
   <li>RESTORE.TNC
 </ul>
</ul>    

Note: If you have defined a serial port in aprsd.conf (eg: tncport /dev/ttyS0)
the value of "MyCall" specified in aprsd.conf will be replaced
with whatever it is in INIT.TNC. This action is new in version 2.1.2.
<p>

<ul>
</ul>

At this point INSTALL has created a directory
/home/aprsd2/ and copied several files
into it.  It also has copied aprsd.init 
to various /etc/rc.d/ directories. <p>

<hr>
</a>


 

<a name="running">
<h3>Starting and Stopping the Server</h3>

After you run INSTALL the server will start when the machine is booted up.
To start without rebooting cd to /etc/rc.d/init.d and run the aprsd.init 
script with "start" as the parameter.  eg:  ./aprsd.init start <p>

You can also start it as a daemon by using the -d option. eg: ./aprsd -d <p>

The serial device for TNC data and tcp port numbers are set in the
/home/aprsd2/aprsd.conf file.  You can edit this file in the directory you used
to uncompress the distribution files then run INSTALL to make the
changes effective.  INSTALL also will copy the distribution welcome.txt,
INIT.TNC and RESTORE.TNC to /home/aprsd so be sure you make changes to
these in the distribution directory before running INSTALL. <p>


To stop the server go to the /etc/rc.d/init.d directory and
enter "./aprsd.init stop".  To restart enter "./aprsd.init start" . <p>
<hr>

<h3>RUNNING AS A PROGRAM </h3>

The server can be run as a regular program for testing purposes or if you
don't want it to auto start when Linux boots. <p>

First, stop the aprsd daemon by entering: /etc/rc.d/init.d/aprsd.init stop .<p>

It can be re-started as a user program changing to the /home/aprsd2 directory
and typing its name " ./aprsd "  Note: you will need to be logged on
as root unless your user name has write priviliges on the directory /home/aprsd2
and all the files in it.<p>

If you want to be able to log on as remote sysop and take control of the
TNC you will need to add a "tnc" group to the /etc/group file.
See "REMOTE TNC SYSOP ACCESS" below for more details.<p>

 <hr> 
 </a>
 
<a name="program">      

<h3>INSTALLING AS A PROGRAM </h3>
    (You may want to do this first to try it out)<p>

<ul>
<li>Login as root.

<li>Copy the archive into your home directory.

<li>Issue the following commands:
<ul>

<li>tar zxvf aprsd214.tar.gz
<li>cd aprsd214
<li>Note: The following command will also compile the source files
<li>./INSTALLPGM
<li>cd /home/aprsd2

The program and configuration files are copied to /home/aprsd2.
You will need to change the permissions on /home/aprsd2 and all the files
in it if you want to run it as a user other than root.  The Linux password
validator will only work if aprsd run as root.

<a name="commandline">
<h3>COMMAND LINE PARAMETERS</h3>

The server has two command line arguments, the name of the server configuration
file and one switch "-d" for daemon mode.  If no file name is provided the server
 will use /home/aprsd2/aprsd.conf . <p>

While running, once each minute this server will emit a status message to the console.
Also, it tells you each time it sends out a packet and to how many users.  It
also shows you what it's sending to the TNC.  One field in the status message
is aprsString Objs.  This is a debugging tool to help find memory leaks.  It should
be no more than 1 or 2 higher than the History items field. Sometimes it will
read much higher but should return to a difference of 1 or 2 within a minute or so.<p>

Ctrl-C or "q" will shut down the server in an
 orderly manner and save the current history
list (last 30 mins of select received data) to disk.<p>

<h3>SERVER CONFIGURATION FILE </h3>

The default configuration file is /home/aprsd2/aprsd.conf.  The file is read
on start up.  Lines starting with "#" are comments and are ignored.  Documentation
on syntax and key words are in the file.  More information on the tcpip ports used
by the server can be found in <a href="ports.html"> ports.html</a> <p>

<h4>igateMyCall</h4>
The "igateMyCall &#60yes|no&#62" command is new in version 2.1.0 . If the "yes"
option is chosen packets sent from your TNC and digipeated will be igated to 
the Internet.  If you have a beacon sending the same position as in your
NetBeacon both will be overlayed and unreadable on the users map.  If you must
igate your own TNC beacons you can offset the location of one of them
about .02 north or south so they show as separate objects.<p>

<h3>IGATE PORTS </h3>


The "igate" commands in the configuration file above define the distant APRServe and
other IGATES you want to establish connections to.  You may choose zero to 20.  Duplicate
data will not be relayed to your users.  Connections which drop will be reestablished
automatically.  After a connection drops it will attempt to reconnect after 1 minute.
If that attempt fails it will try again in 2 minutes. The time will double each time
until it hits 16 minutes.  Then it will retry forever at 16 minute intervals.
These connection attempts appear in the aprsd.log file. <p>

Which ports on the distant igates do you connect to?  There are two ways to go.
You can connect to the ports which emit only local data (APRServe 1313 or 
aprsmon 14580) or you can choose one reliable server and connect
to the port which supplies the complete data stream (APRServe 23 or aprsd 10152).
In either case it should be a port which doesn't do the history file dump when
you first connect.   Connecting to local ports on ALL other servers will be more
reliable since a single failure won't cut off all your external data. <p>

This server has a port (1314) which only supplies station to station messages and corresponding
posits.  Other servers which will be used ONLY to relay 3rd party station to station
messages to their local VHF network may want to connect to this port to greatly
reduce the amount of data on their tcpip connection. <p>

<a name="comports">
<h3>
COM PORT CONFIGURATION
</h3>  	
The TNC COM port is fixed at 9600 baud, 1 stop bit, 8 data bits and no parity.
Be sure the TNC is configured to these parameters.  You can use the terminal
program "minicom" that comes with Linux to prepare the TNC.  Make sure the
TNC is NOT in KISS mode.<p>
 
Be sure the device ( dev/ttyS* ) has the proper read/write permissions or the
server will not be able to access it. <p>

Root can set the serial port so it can be written to by anyone
with the following command: <p>

	chmod ugo+w /dev/ttyS0 <p>
	

NOTE: If you don't define a device for the com port in the aprsd.conf
file all TNC related functions in the server are disabled.<p>

<h3>SHUTTING DOWN THE SERVER WHEN RUNNING AS A PROGRAM</h3>


Ctrl-C or "q" will shut down the server in an

REMOTE TNC SYSOP ACCESS - (ESC)
</h3>

You may telnet to the APRS server and connect to the TNC for the purpose
of changing parameters or even sending data out over the radio channel.
Use the (ESC) key from a telnet session to enter remote access mode.
Some Telnet programs send data a line at a time so the (ESC) character
will not be sent until you hit the (Enter) key. <p>
  
You'll be prompted for your user name and password.  
These must match an entry in the Linux password file. In other
words, a valid Linux login user/password.  If the password is incorrect
remote sysop mode will be exited. The user must	also
belong to the "tnc" group.  This group must be created
in the /etc/group file. Here is an example line: <p>

tnc::102:root,wa4dsy,bozo <p>

In this example users root,wa4dsy and bozo are assigned to the tnc group.<p>



After you have logged on, everything you type goes to the TNC and
all TNC output data goes only to you.  The TNC is effectivly disconnected
from all other internet users.  Hit control-C to get the TNC into command mode. <p>

 
To exit remote TNC access hit the <ESC> key.  You may also need to
hit <Enter> if your Telnet program sends data a line at a time.	Some

<h3>

STATION TO STATION MESSAGES
</h3>

This program will reformat and relay aprs 
station to station messages from the Internet 
to the TNC for RF transmission under the following
conditions. <p>

It came from a logged on verified registered user. <p>

 and <p>
 
 The originator was not seen on the TNC RF data stream
 in the past 30 minutes.<p>
 
 and   <p>
 
 The destination HAS been seen on the TNC RF data stream
 in the past 30 minutes and doesn't have "GATE*" in his path
 and has been repeated less than 3  times.  <p>
 
 and <p>

 The line "rf-allow yes" is in the /home/aprsd2/aprsd.conf file. <p>

Version 2.0.8 and later allows you to define up to 64 message destination call signs
or aliases which will always be gated to RF if "rf-allow yes" has been defined.
See the example aprsd.conf file for an example of how to use the "msgdest2rf"
command to enable this feature.
 
For each 3rd party messge delivered to RF the latest position report
packet of the originating station will also be sent after reformating
the path in 3rd party format.  The program pulls the posit from the
history list if it's in there. <p> 

eg: <p>

KE6DJZ>AP0917,KB6TLJ-5,RELAY,WIDE:=3415.99N/11844.34WyAPRS+SA <p>


becomes:<p>

}KE6DJZ>AP0917,TCPIP,WA4DSY*:=3415.99N/11844.34WyAPRS+SA  <p>

(assuming "MyCall" is WA4DSY ) <p>

During a series of messages the position packet will only
be sent with a message every 10 minutes unless the station emits and new one.<p>


This server will NOT igate a 3rd party _reformatted_ 
message from RF to the Internet.  This is strictly one way. <p>


Users of unregisterd client programs can send their own
station-to-station messages to other Internet users.  These
messages will not go out on the TNC RF channel and the path
will be modified (TCPIP is changed to TCPXX*) so other
hubs will know not to send these messages out on their RF
channels.  Unregistered users cannot Igate packets other
than their own.  In other words, the ax25 source call 
in their packets must match their logon call and "TCPIP" must
be in the path. (TCPIP* or TCPXX* will not work either) <p>

eg; assume N0CALL is unregistered and attempts to send
the following into the server.<p>

N0CALL>APRS,TCPIP:>TESTING <br>     
This will be converted to  N0CALL>APRS,TCPXX*:>TESTING
and gated to other users (but not to RF!) <p>

However... <br>
W4ZZZ>APRS,TCPIP:>TESTING <br>
or<br>
N0CALL>APRS,TCPIP*:>TESTING <br>
will be deleted and not sent anywhere.<br>


Telnet users must provide a user name or call sign
before any of their data can be relayed to the internet.
They need to enter "user callsign pass -1" so the server will
accept the data.  The ax25 FROM call in packets they send
must match the call sign they loggon with.  If they provide
a valid password full priviliges are granted since they
used the keyboard to emulate a client program logon string.
(Not that anyone would want to do this except for testing) <p>

This server will also accept valid user/password combinations
for the Linux system it is running on.  These users must be in
the aprs group.  This group can be added by editing the /etc/group file. <p> 

Note: <p>

This program trusts other versions of itself and APRServe to
flag the paths of data from unregistered Internet users with "TCPXX*".
Station to station messages flagged this way will not be sent out on RF.
The IGATE commands in the aprsd.conf file should specify a remote host port
which is secure. For IGATES it must be a port which doesn't echo any
Internet user data, only TNC data.  Full function servers such as APRServe
and this version (2.x.x) of aprsd will change TCPIP* to TCPXX* in the paths 
of unregistered users on  all ports. <p>

Users of the current java APRS applet don't log at all and are granted read-only access<p>

<hr>

<a name="msgacks">
<h3>MESSAGE ACKS   (New in 2.0.7)</h3>
At the suggestion of Bob Bruninga I have implemented redundent message acks.
Message packets of the form "WA4DSY>APRS::W4XYZ    :ack{1" will be reformatted to
3rd party format and sent to the TNC as usual. However, the packet will be repeated
several times at intervals of 5 (typical) seconds.  The number of repeats and the time
between them are defined by the "ackrepeats" and "ackrepeattime" statements
in the aprsd.conf file.  The defaults are 2 repeats at 5 second intervals.
You can set the repeats to any value from 0 to 9 and the time interval
from 1 to 30 seconds.  Note the "ackrepeats" value is in additon to the
first message ack.  You will always send at least one.
<p>
<hr>
</a>



<a name="validate">
<h3>USER VALIDATION</h3>

I obtained the user validation code from Steve Dimse K4HG.  He
has recently allowed the source code to be released. The source is in validate.cpp.  
<p>
If the users APRS name and pass code aren't valid the validate module tries the Linux
pass word validator for the "aprs" group.  If that also fails
it waits 10 seconds then returns the bad news to aprsd which notifies the user. <p>
<em> NOTE: aprsd must be run as root for the Linux password validator to work.
</em>
However, the APRS user and passwords (from Mac/WinAPRS users) 
will be properly tested regardless of what user is running aprsd if
"aprsPass yes" is in the aprsd.conf file.
<br>
<p>

The logon format:  <p>

user <call sign> pass <pass code> vers <Program version><p>

eg: user N0CALL pass 00001 vers MacAPRS 3.0<br> 
might be sent by a MacAPRS user. <br>

As pass code of -1 means you are an unregistered user,
not a hacker trying out an bogus password. <p>

You can telent to a port and enter the following,
assuming your Linux user name is bozo and you password is
xyzzy and you are part of the aprs group as defined in
the /etc/group file. <p>

user bozo pass xyzzy <p>

To monitor some server status data you can enter: <p>

user bozo pass xyzzy vers monitor  <p>

The aprs data stream is turned off and "Monitor Mode" is entered.
Once a minute the server will send a status message to you.<p>

Once you have logged on, ctrl-D will not cause a disconnect.
You have to use your Telnet escape key then do a quit.
I had to do this to prevent inadvertant disconnects due to
possible spurious control codes in some users data. <p>


<hr>
</a>

<a name="abuse">
<h3>
KEEPING ABUSERS OUT OF THE SYSTEM (New in 2.1.0)
</h3>
You can put the call signs of the users you want to
restrict in the users.deny file.  The format is 
the users call sign followed by either
the letter "L" or "R".  The "L" prevents logons and RF access.
The "R" prevents only RF access while allowing the user to
send packets into the aprs network.
<p>
<pre>
user.deny example:

W4EVIL L   <--- Prevents sending of packets into the server or RF
W4SOB R    <--- Prevents any of his packets from getting on RF
		even if they came from another igate.


NOTE: This file is read every time aprsd needs to check users
so you will NOT need to restart the server when you change it.
</pre>
If the abuse becomes serious enough you might consider
putting "aprsPass no" in the aprsd.conf file.  This turns off
the checking of aprs passcodes and only allows Linux user/passwords.
You will need to have all your users in the Linux passwd file.

<a name="inet2rf">
<h3>
Full time gating of selected stations from Internet to RF</h3>

For special events or personal reasons it may be desirable
to allow the transfer of packets of selected stations from
the Internet to RF.  Allowing all stations to do this would
overload the 1200 baud VHF packet frequency and isn't allowed.
These packets are only sent on RF if they came from the Internet
and were NOT heard on the local VHF frequency.<p>

There are three "modes" of doing this.  The most permissive
allows all packets from a selected station to be sent to RF
in real time.  The second mode only allows position report packets
to be sent on RF every 14.9 minutes.  This puts much less strain
on the RF network and is the recommended mode.<p>

The third mode which was new in version 2.0.8 gates 3rd party station
to station messages to RF full time if the DESTINATION call sign or alias
is defined in the aprsd.conf file after the msgdest2rf keyword.<p>


You select the stations by entering them in the /home/aprsd2/aprsd.conf file.
Up to 64 stations can be defined. Several can be put on each line.
The server must be restarted before any changes to aprsd.conf take effect. <p>


Examples:<br>
<pre>
These stations posits are sent to RF every 15 minutes: 
posit2rf K4HG-8 N4NEQ-9 
posit2rf W7LUS-14

All packets from this station are gated to RF full time.
gate2rf N0CLU-9



This allows any message addressed to SCOUTS, KIDS or CQGA to go to
RF even though these "call signs" were not heard locally.
msgdest2rf SCOUTS KIDS CQGA

</pre>


Note: The posits of stations in the "posit2rf" list are sent at 14 second
intervals.  It takes 14.9 minutes to scan the list of 64 before it repeats.
The posits are taken from the 30 minute history list.  If no posit
is available for the station then no data is transmitted.

<h3>

MIC_E PACKET TRANSLATION </h3>

Compressed TAPR Mic_E packets are converted to standard APRS format
before being sent anywhere else. I used the Mic_E decoder written by
Alan Crosswell, N2YGK to do the conversion. This is the same code that's
in his aprsmon program. <p>
The unconverted raw Mic_E packets from the local TNC 
can be observed by telneting to port 14580.

<a name="aea_tapr">
<h3>AEA to TAPR conversion </h3>

All packets in the AEA format are converted to TAPR format 
before any other processing.  Clients never see an AEA
formatted packet except from the RAW TNC port (14580) if the system
operator is using an AEA TNC. <p>
<hr>
</a>

<a name="udp">

<h3>UDP PORT</h3>

The UDP input port (default 1315) is provided for interface with
scripts.  Only IP addresses listed in the "trust" line(s) in the
aprsd.conf file are can send data to this port.  You can enter
up to 20 trust commands. <p>

Example: <br>
<pre>
trust 198.162.50.5 <p>
</pre>
You may also provide a subnet mask after the ip address
to open up an entire sub net. The example below allows
16 address from 198.162.50.0 to 198.162.50.15 .<p>

Example:<br>
<pre>
trust 198.162.50.0 255.255.255.240 <p>
 </pre>
The script can format packets to be sent to the TNC for RF transmission
or TCPIP.  The routing is determined by the "TO-CALL" field.  If it's
"TNC" the packet goes on on RF via the TNC after the path is striped off. <p>

This goes to the TNC:  WA4DSY>TNC:Data for TNC here <br>
This goes to TCPIP:    WA4DSY>APRS:Data for the Internet <p>

The complete string including the path goes out on the Internet. <p>

<h3>
RESPONDING TO QUERIES	(New in 2.1.0)
</h3>
The aprsd server will respond to aprs queries as follows:<br>

query:<br>
<pre>
WA4DSY&#62APRS:?IGATE? 
or
WA4DSY&#62APRS::IGATE    :?IGATE?{0
or
WA4DSY&#62APRS::aprsd    :?IGATE?{0

<h3> APRS passcode calculator (new in 2.1.1)</h3>
The aprspass program is located in the /home/aprsd2 directory.
You may move it to another more convienient location if you wish.
To determine the aprs passcode required for a callsign "N0CALL": <br>
Change to the /home/aprsd2 directory.<br>
<pre>
./aprspass N0CALL
APRS passcode for N0CALL = 12345
</pre>
The program will print the passcode "12345".  You may use this 5 digit number
as a password to connect and login to other igates and APRServe.
The callsign and passcode are used as follows in aprsd.conf.
<pre>
igate second.aprs.net 23 N0CALL 12345
</pre>
This causes aprsd to connect the second.aprs.net, port 23.  Data from
that server becomes available at your server.  Your TNC data and logged on
Internet user data is sent to second.aprs.net over the two way connection.
<br>
Please use your <em>real</em> callsign!

<h3>
Monitoring system status with a web browser (new in 2.1.2)
</h3>
System operators can now check the operational status of their
aprsd server with a web browser.  The default port is 14501. To
see the information simply enter the URL into the browser.<br>
Example: To see the Miami server: http://first.aprs.net:14501/<br>
To refresh the data click the browser reload button.  Notice the
igate domain names and user IP addresses are links.  If the host
is running aprsd 212 or later you can click on the link to see
the status of that server.
This is an open port, no passwords are required. <p>
To <em>disable</em> this feature add to your aprsd.conf file: httpport 0

<h3>
Determining the source IP address of aprs packets (new in 2.1.2)
</h3>
  
This TCPIP port (default 14502) supplies all data streams without dup filtering with
a special header prepended. The header contains the source IP address of the
packet and the user login name, "IGATE" or "UDP".  An example: !44.36.16.48:WA4DSY!
Packets from other igates this server connected to will show the domain name
instead of the IP address and the user will be "IGATE".  Packets from the UDP port
will have the IP address and the user field will be "UDP".  Packets from the TNC
will have "TNC" in the IP address field and "*" in the user field .
Use telnet or nc optionally with grep to determine the source of packets.  <br>
eg: telnet first.aprs.net 23 | grep '199.45.66.88' <br>
Will display only packets from IP address 199.45.66.88.<p>
To <em>disable</em> this feature add to your aprsd.conf file: ipwatchport 0

<h3>
KNOWN BUGS
</h3>

<h3>
Slow connection establishment to igates and hubs</h3>
Due to bugs in the "thread-safe" gethostbyname2_r() function
I had to put mutual exclusion semaphores around it.  The result is that
when igate and hub connections are being established, only <em>one</em>
host name lookup can be in progress at any time.  If the host name is not
found due to the name server being down, it can take up to a minute
for that name lookup to complete.  If you have 30 aprs.net igates in the
list and the aprs.net name server is down, it can take up to 30 minutes
to try them all.

<h3>
Memory Leak
</h3>

Under RedHat 5.1 this program leaks 8K of memory for each user
connect/disconnect event.  This appears to be a problem with one or more
C libraries in the thread creation/destruction code. 
It has been fixed in 5.2. <p>

To get the fix for 5.1surf over to  
<a href="ftp://ftp.redhat.com/pub/redhat/upgrades/5.1/i386/">
ftp://ftp.redhat.com/pub/redhat/upgrades/5.1/i386/ </a><p>

Then get this file: <br>

glibc-2.0.7-19.i386.rpm <p>

The memory leak seems to be fixed in this version.
To install do:  rpm -U  glibc-2.0.7-19.i386.rpm
then reboot. You don't need to recompile aprsd! <p>
