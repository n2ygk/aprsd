<H2>WA4DSY Linux APRS server docs. 2.1.5 Aug. 2002</H2>

<h3>Notes for 2.1.5</h3>
This is a bug fix release combined with several new features. It will now compile and
run on Red Hat 7.x . For details see the <a href="revisions.txt">revisions.txt</a> file. <p>
If upgrading, please replace your original aprsd.init file with the new one suppled in this release.<br>
There are also some new features in the aprsd.conf file.<p> Also please add 2 new log files
to your /etc/logrotate.conf file.  They are loop.log and reject.log .<p>

Please read README.STLport for information about a thread-safe stl library
and how to build aprsd to use it.<p>

Most noteworthy changes are:<p>

0) Now will compile with both gnu 2.9 and 3.1 compilers. The 3.1 compiler will
emit lots of "deprecated" warnings but they can be ignored.<p>

1) Added wild card "*" support to "gate2rf" command in aprsd.conf.  See <a href="#inet2rf">
gating to RF</a> section for details. <p>

2) Added filter code in aprsString to reject "EH?" and "cmd:" packets. Packets that don't
look like ax25 format or are longer than 250 bytes are rejected.<p>

3) Removed directed query responses.  Fixed general query "?IGATE?" response to comply with
APRS spec 1.0. <br>
Example query response: <br>  
testaprsd>APD215,TCPIP*:&lt;IGATE,MSG_CNT=0,LOC_CNT=0,CALL=WA4DSY,LOCATION=Atlanta_GA,<br>HOST=lab1.wa4dsy.net,IP=216.27.174.141,EMAIL=sysop@myisp.net,VERS=aprsd 2.1.5 
<br> Also blocked ?IGATE? queries from RF to Internet.  A query from RF will only trigger a single response from the igate(s) that hear the station on RF.
<p> 


4) Stopped sending System Status messages on Link port (1313) and Message Port (1314).<br>
    You will no longer get<br> 
    "aprsdATL>JAVA::javaMSG  :Atlanta_GA Linux APRS Server: 127.0.0.1 connected 2 users online." <br>
    and other such messages on these ports as other users connect and disconnect. However, to provide
    compatibility with some applicaitons that verify their own logon with these messages, the apps
    own connect and logon status messages still be sent back.  In other words, you see your own
    logon activity by no one elses.<p>
    
5) Removed code which cleared the 8th bit of users data. This allows 8 bit wide characrter sets to be passed.<p>
    
6)  Added support for NOGATE or RFONLY in path.  If a packet from any source has NOGATE or RFONLY in the
    path it will discarded and not be put on the Internet.  <p>
    
7)  The server now <a href="#PktSource"> adds information</a> to the end of the ax25 PATH indicating the
    source of each packet . eg: qAR,WA4DSY. This is known as the "q Construct".  As of beta 8 the format
    complies with modifications and improvements made by Pete Loveall AE5PL.<p>
    
    
8) Added <a href="ports.html#omniport">OmniPort</a>.  This new port lets the users define their own custom streams.
   It defaults to 14600.<p>
   
9 ) Added new keyword  "Server"  to aprsd.conf file.  
    It replaces the old "Igate" command (although Igate is still honored).
    A command such as "server first.aprs.net 23 hub-sr" defines the connection
    to first.aprs.net as a send/receive hub connection.  The user passcode
    is supplied with another keyword "pass".  See <a href="#configfile">aprsd.conf</a>
     docs for details. <p>
    

10) Added a new page of data to the html status page.  Clicking on the users
    port number opens port filter status in a new window.  There you can
    observe which streams each user is being sent. This became importaint
    because of the new OmniPort and its user definable streams. <p>
    
11) Added bandwidth controls.  Sysop may now specify the maximum allowed server
    load in bytes/sec.  New users are rejected when the limit would be exceeded
    and the latest high bandwith users are disconnected if the load increases
    beyond the specfied limit.  Keyword is "MaxLoad" in aprsd.conf . <p>
    
12) <a href="#remotetnc">TNC sysop mode</a> can only be accessed from the new TncSysopPort 14500.
    Aprsd will now automatically put your telnet client into character-at-a-time
    mode for better operation with the TNC command line.
    
<p>

To conform to standard practice I suggest changing your BEACON strings to
show a GATEWAY diamond with an "I" overlay. Below is an example from the
aprsd.conf file.  Your existing file may have the symbol set to "TCPIP"
if you are upgrading from previous aprsd versions. <p>

EXAMPLE: <br>
NetBeacon 10 !0000.00NI00000.00W& aprsd Linux APRS Server<br>

The symbols are defined in the APRS Spec document in appendix 2
and on page 89.


<hr>
Everyone: You will need to compile the code get a working
executable for your system. This is done automatically by the install script.
Be advised you need the c++ compiler installed on your system.
You can also type "make" to compile the program.
It is designed to work on RedHat 5.1 and later
Linux distributions.  This includes Mandrake. Others may or may not work.
Early versions before 5.1 will not work.

<a name="description">
<h3>DESCRIPTION </h3>
This is an APRS Internet server program.  It acts as a gateway between
the Internet and a local ham VHF APRS packet network. It is interfaced to
directly to a TNC via one of the PC serial ports and does not use the Linux
ax25 sockets interface. Hamish Moffatt has a 
<a href="http://aprs.moffatt.nu/aprsd.shtml">modified version of aprsd </a>
with ax25 support.<p>

It has only been tested on RedHat Linux 5.1 , 5.2, 6.0 and Mandrake 5.3 - 8.1 .  It requires libstdc++ 2.8.0 or later
to run.  It will NOT run on RedHat 4.2. <p>

The program gets data from a TNC connected to a serial port
and sends it to all clients who have connected to any of several user
defined tcp ports. Some defaults are 1313, 10151, 10152 and 14579.	 
It was designed to duplicate most if not all of the functionality of
APRServe, a Macintosh APRS server designed and coded by Steve Dimse, K4HG.<br>
<a href="http://www.aprs.net/aprserve.dcc.html"> See http://www.aprs.net/aprserve.dcc.html</a> <br>
It can also gate data coming from the Internet to the TNC for
transmission on the local VHF RF network.<p>


<h4>CLIENT SOFTWARE</h4>
Users can connect using several client programs such as Mac/WinAPRS,
javAPRS, <a href="http://www.eazy.net/users/fgiannan/linux/"> Xastir for Linux</a>
 and Telnet.  The logon protocol used by Mac/WinAPRS and others is recognized
and properly handled giving registered users the privilige of sending
3rd party messages into the local VHF network. <p>

Clients can use telnet to watch TNC data.<br>
eg: telnet www.wa4dsy.net 14579 <br>
If raw TNC data is desired port 14580 can be used.<p>

Scripts written in languages such as perl can connect to the
server and interact with the data. A UDP port is provided to simplify
injection of data into the aprs stream by scripts. <p>

The system operator can use telnet to monitor the server status
by connecting to any port and enter entering his callsign and passcode
and entering "monitor" for the version field. eg: user WA4ZZZ pass 12345 vers monitor <br>
 Also he can enter remote  sysop mode and gain direct control of the TNC on sysop port 14500. <br>

<p>


<h4>HISTORY LIST</h4>
A history of data from the TNC and IGATES going back 35 minutes (time also user defined) is kept in
memory and delivered to each user when he connects.  This
history data is filtered to remove duplicates and certain
other unwanted information.  Duplicate data are detected by looking
for any packets with the same data and source call sign that have
been seen in the last 20 seconds. When duplicates are found they are discarded.<p>

There is also a quota system to further reduce the quanity of data in the history list.
Each AX25 source call sign is allowed three packets in the history
list.  One position report, one weather report and one "other".	Only the
most receint of each type is retained. <p>

<h3>INSTALLING AS A DAEMON</h3>
<em> (** also see Installing as a Program below **) </em><p>
Note that this also compiles the program if the executable
"aprsd" does NOT exist in the source directory.  To re-compile
updates in this directory you must do: "make clean" then "make".<p>
<ul>
<li>Login as root.

<li>Copy the archive into your home directory.

<li>Issue the following command:

<li>tar zxvf aprsd215.tgz

<li>Of course you already did it or you wouldn't be reading this ;-)

<li>cd aprsd215

<LI>Note: The following command will also compile the source files

<li>./INSTALLDAEMON

<li>cd /home/aprsd2

<li>Now make any changes you may require to these files (in /home/aprsd2/): <br>
Note: The install program will not overwrite these if they already exist.
 <ul>   
   <li> aprsd.conf
   <li> user.deny
   <li> welcome.txt
   <li>INIT.TNC
   <li>RESTORE.TNC
 </ul>
</ul>    

Note: If you have defined a serial port in aprsd.conf (eg: tncport /dev/ttyS0)
the value of "MyCall" specified in aprsd.conf will be replaced
with whatever it is in INIT.TNC. This action is new in version 2.1.2.
<p>

<ul>
</ul>

At this point INSTALL has created a directory
/home/aprsd2/ and copied several files
into it.  It also has copied aprsd.init 
to various /etc/rc.d/ directories. <p>

<hr>
</a>


 

<a name="running">
<h3>Starting and Stopping the Server</h3>

After you run INSTALL the server will start when the machine is booted up.
To start without rebooting cd to /etc/rc.d/init.d and run the aprsd.init 
script with "start" as the parameter.  eg:  ./aprsd.init start <p>

You can also start it as a daemon by using the -d option. eg: ./aprsd -d <p>

The serial device for TNC data and tcp port numbers are set in the
/home/aprsd2/aprsd.conf file.  You can edit this file in the directory you used
to uncompress the distribution files then run INSTALL to make the
changes effective.  INSTALL also will copy the distribution welcome.txt,
INIT.TNC and RESTORE.TNC to /home/aprsd so be sure you make changes to
these in the distribution directory before running INSTALL. <p>


To stop the server go to the /etc/rc.d/init.d directory and
enter "./aprsd.init stop".  To restart enter "./aprsd.init start" . Also, you can
use the "service" command. eg: service aprsd.init start .<p>
<hr>

<h3>RUNNING AS A PROGRAM </h3>

The server can be run as a regular program for testing purposes or if you
don't want it to auto start when Linux boots. <p>

First, stop the aprsd daemon by entering: /etc/rc.d/init.d/aprsd.init stop 
or "service aprsd.init stop" .<p>

It can be re-started as a user program changing to the /home/aprsd2 directory
and typing its name " ./aprsd "  Note: you will need to be logged on
as root unless your user name has write priviliges on the directory /home/aprsd2
and all the files in it.<p>

If you want to be able to log on as remote sysop and take control of the
TNC you will need to add a "tnc" group to the /etc/group file.
See "REMOTE TNC SYSOP ACCESS" below for more details.<p>

 <hr> 
 </a>
 
<a name="program">      

<h3>INSTALLING AS A PROGRAM </h3>
    (You may want to do this first to try it out)<p>
    
 Note that this also compiles the program if the executable
"aprsd" does NOT exist in the source directory.  To re-compile
updates in this directory you must do: "make clean" then "make".<p>

<ul>
<li>Login as root.

<li>Copy the archive into your home directory.

<li>Issue the following commands:
<ul>

<li>tar zxvf aprsd215.tgz
<li>cd aprsd215
<li>Note: The following command will also compile the source files
<li>./INSTALLPGM
<li>cd /home/aprsd2
</ul>
   Now make any changes you may require to welcome.txt, INIT.TNC, RESTORE.TNC
   and aprsd.conf to reflect your call sign, location and TNC paramters.
<br>
Note: The install program will not overwrite these if they already exist.


</ul>
The program and configuration files are copied to /home/aprsd2.
You will need to change the permissions on /home/aprsd2 and all the files
in it if you want to run it as a user other than root.  The Linux password
validator will only work if aprsd run as root.

<a name="commandline">
<h3>COMMAND LINE PARAMETERS</h3>

The server has two command line arguments, the name of the server configuration
file and one switch "-d" for daemon mode.  If no file name is provided the server
 will use /home/aprsd2/aprsd.conf . <p>

While running, once each minute this server will emit a status message to the console.
Also, it tells you each time it sends out a packet and to how many users.  It
also shows you what it's sending to the TNC.  One field in the status message
is aprsString Objs.  This is a debugging tool to help find memory leaks.  It should
be no more than 1 or 2 higher than the History items field. Sometimes it will
read much higher but should return to a difference of 1 or 2 within a minute or so.<p>

Ctrl-C or "q" will shut down the server in an
 orderly manner and save the current history
list (last 30 mins of select received data) to disk.<p>

<hr>
</a>


<a name="configfile">
<h3>SERVER CONFIGURATION FILE </h3>

The default configuration file is /home/aprsd2/aprsd.conf.  The file is read
on start up.  Lines starting with "#" are comments and are ignored.  Documentation
on syntax and key words are in the file.  More information on the tcpip ports used
by the server can be found in <a href="ports.html"> ports.html</a> <p>

<h4>igateMyCall</h4>
The "igateMyCall &lt;yes|no&gt;" command is new in version 2.1.0 . If the "yes"
option is chosen packets sent from your TNC and digipeated will be igated to 
the Internet.  If you have a beacon sending the same position as in your
NetBeacon both will be overlayed and unreadable on the users map.  If you must
igate your own TNC beacons you can offset the location of one of them
about .02 north or south so they show as separate objects.<p>

#The TYPE-DIR field sets the connection type and data flow.
#TYPE is  either "SERVER" or "HUB"
#SERVER connections attempt to maintain a connection to the designated host.
#HUB connections maintain a connection to only ONE hub and rotate to the next
#if the connection fails.
#DIR is either "RO" or "SR"  RO is Receive Only. SR is Send and Receive.
#Eamples: HUB-RO   HUB-SR  SERVER-RO SERVER-SR
#If you select -SR to send data you must also supply a passcode
#using the "PASS" command.
#These commands are NOT case sensitive.
#
#The PASS command.  The callsign supplied in MyCall and this
# passcode allow you to send data to distant servers.
# PASS can be computed from MYCALL with the aprspass program.
# Note: this example is invalid.

<h3>IGATE PORTS </h3>


The "Server" commands in the configuration file above define the distant APRServe and
other Servers or HUBS you want to establish connections to.  You may choose zero to 100.  Duplicate
data will not be relayed to your users.  Connections which drop will be reestablished
automatically.  After a connection drops it will attempt to reconnect after 1 minute.
If that attempt fails it will try again in 2 minutes. The time will double each time
until it hits 16 minutes.  Then it will retry forever at 16 minute intervals.
These connection attempts appear in the aprsd.log file. <p>

Use the HUB mode (hub-sr) only with APRS servers which carry the full global feed
such as first.aprs.net, second.aprs.net and third.aprs.net.  Using HUB
with all 3 of these establishes  a single connection to one of them.
When that connection fails the next one will be tried until a new connection is
established. <p> 

Server mode (server-ro or server-sr) connections should be used for regional servers that
do not carry the full aprs data stream.<p>

This server has a port (1314) which only supplies station to station messages and corresponding
posits.  Other servers which will be used ONLY to relay 3rd party station to station
messages to their local VHF network may want to connect to this port to greatly
reduce the amount of data on their tcpip connection. <p>

<h3>
COM PORT CONFIGURATION
</h3>  	
The TNC COM port default to 9600 baud, 1 stop bit, 8 data bits and no parity.
You may change the baud rate with the "TNCBAUD" command in aprsd.conf.
Be sure the TNC is configured to these parameters.  You can use the terminal
program "minicom" that comes with Linux to prepare the TNC.  Make sure the
TNC is NOT in KISS mode.<p>
 
Be sure the device ( dev/ttyS* ) has the proper read/write permissions or the
server will not be able to access it. <p>

Root can set the serial port so it can be written to by anyone
with the following command: <p>

	chmod ugo+w /dev/ttyS0 <p>
	

NOTE: If you don't define a device for the com port in the aprsd.conf
file all TNC related functions in the server are disabled.<p>

<h3>SHUTTING DOWN THE SERVER WHEN RUNNING AS A PROGRAM</h3>


Ctrl-C or "q" will shut down the server in an
 orderly manner and saves the current history
list (last 30 mins of received TNC data) to disk.<p> 

Ctrl-\ shuts down without saving anything.<p>

When running as a daemon you can shut it down

<h3>
REMOTE TNC SYSOP ACCESS on Port 14500 
</h3>

You may telnet to the APRS server and connect to the TNC for the purpose
of changing parameters or even sending data out over the radio channel.
As of version 215 you must use the SysOpPort (default 14500).
Use the (ESC) key from a telnet session to enter remote access mode.

  
You'll be prompted for your user name and password.  
These must match an entry in the Linux password file. In other
words, a valid Linux login user/password.  Also, aprsd must
be running as root to be able to validate Linux passwords.
If the password is incorrect
remote sysop mode will be exited. The user must	also
belong to the "tnc" group.  This group must be created
in the /etc/group file. Here is an example line: <p>

tnc::102:root,wa4dsy,bozo <p>

In this example users root,wa4dsy and bozo are assigned to the tnc group.<p>



After you have logged on, everything you type goes to the TNC and
all TNC output data goes only to you.  The TNC is effectivly disconnected
from all other internet users.  Hit control-C to get the TNC into command mode. <p>

 
To exit remote TNC access hit the <ESC> key.  You may also need to
hit <Enter> if your Telnet program sends data a line at a time.	Some
Telnet programs can be configured for character at a time mode.  Check
your documentation for details. As of version 2.1.5 aprsd should put
your telnet client into character-at-a-time mode automatically.<p>

<h3>

STATION TO STATION 3RD PARTY MESSAGES
</h3>

This program will reformat and relay APRS 
 messages from the Internet 
to the TNC for RF transmission under the following
conditions. <p>

It came from a logged on verified registered user. <p>

 and <p>
 
 The originator was not seen on the TNC RF data stream
 in the past 30 minutes.<p>
 
 and   <p>
 
 The destination HAS been seen on the TNC RF data stream
 in the past 30 minutes and doesn't have "GATE*" in his path
 and has been repeated less than 3  times.  <p>
 
 and <p>

 The line "rf-allow yes" is in the /home/aprsd2/aprsd.conf file. <p>

Version 2.0.8 and later allows you to define up to 64 message destination call signs
or aliases which will always be gated to RF if "rf-allow yes" has been defined.
See the example aprsd.conf file for an example of how to use the "msgdest2rf"
command to enable this feature.
 
For each 3rd party messge delivered to RF the latest position report
packet of the originating station will also be sent after reformating
the path in 3rd party format.  The program pulls the posit from the
history list if it's in there. <p> 

eg: <p>

KE6DJZ>AP0917,KB6TLJ-5,RELAY,WIDE:=3415.99N/11844.34WyAPRS+SA <p>


becomes:<p>

}KE6DJZ>AP0917,TCPIP,WA4DSY*:=3415.99N/11844.34WyAPRS+SA  <p>

(assuming "MyCall" is WA4DSY ) <p>

During a series of messages the position packet will only
be sent with a message every 10 minutes unless the station emits and new one.<p>


This server will NOT igate a 3rd party _reformatted_ 
message from RF to the Internet which has been previously
on the Internet. ie: has TCPIP in the 3rd party path.  3rd
party packets without TCPIP in the 3rd party path will be
converted to normal packets and processed in the usual way. <p>


Users of unregisterd client programs can send their own
station-to-station messages to other Internet users.  These
messages will not go out on the TNC RF channel and the path
will be modified (TCPIP is changed to TCPXX*) so other
hubs will know not to send these messages out on their RF
channels.  Unregistered users cannot Igate packets other
than their own.  In other words, the ax25 source call 
in their packets must match their logon call and "TCPIP" must
be in the path. (TCPIP* or TCPXX* will not work either) <p>

eg: assume N0CALL is unregistered and attempts to send
the following into the server.<p>

N0CALL>APRS,TCPIP:>TESTING <br>     
This will be converted to  N0CALL>APRS,TCPXX*:>TESTING
and gated to other users (but not to RF!) <p>

However... <br>
W4ZZZ>APRS,TCPIP:>TESTING <br>
or<br>
N0CALL>APRS,TCPIP*:>TESTING <br>
will be deleted and not sent anywhere.<br>


Telnet users must provide a user name or call sign
before any of their data can be relayed to the internet.
They need to enter "user callsign pass -1" so the server will
accept the data.  The ax25 FROM call in packets they send
must match the call sign they loggon with.  If they provide
a valid password full priviliges are granted since they
used the keyboard to emulate a client program logon string.
(Not that anyone would want to do this except for testing) <p>

This server will also accept valid user/password combinations
for the Linux system it is running on.  These users must be in
the aprs group.  This group can be added by editing the /etc/group file. <p> 

Note: <p>

This program trusts other versions of itself and APRServe to
flag the paths of data from unregistered Internet users with "TCPXX*".
Station to station messages flagged this way will not be sent out on RF.
The IGATE commands in the aprsd.conf file should specify a remote host port
which is secure. For IGATES it must be a port which doesn't echo any
Internet user data, only TNC data.  Full function servers such as APRServe
and this version (2.x.x) of aprsd will change TCPIP* to TCPXX* in the paths 
of unregistered users on  all ports. <p>

Users of the current java APRS applet don't log in at all and are granted read-only access<p>

<a name="msgacks">
<h3>MESSAGE ACKS   (New in 2.0.7)</h3>
At the suggestion of Bob Bruninga I have implemented redundent message acks.
Message packets of the form "WA4DSY>APRS::W4XYZ    :ack{1" will be reformatted to
3rd party format and sent to the TNC as usual. However, the packet will be repeated
several times at intervals of 5 (typical) seconds.  The number of repeats and the time
between them are defined by the "ackrepeats" and "ackrepeattime" statements
in the aprsd.conf file.  The defaults are 2 repeats at 5 second intervals.
You can set the repeats to any value from 0 to 9 and the time interval
from 1 to 30 seconds.  Note the "ackrepeats" value is in additon to the
first message ack.  You will always send at least one.
<p>
<hr>
</a>



<a name="validate">
<h3>USER VALIDATION</h3>

I obtained the user validation code from Steve Dimse K4HG.  He
has recently allowed the source code to be released. The source is in validate.cpp.  
<p>
If the users APRS name and pass code aren't valid the validate module tries the Linux
pass word validator for the "aprs" group.  If that also fails
it waits 10 seconds then returns the bad news to aprsd which notifies the user. <p>
<em> NOTE: aprsd must be run as root for the Linux password validator to work.
</em>
However, the APRS user and passwords (from Mac/WinAPRS users) 
will be properly tested regardless of what user is running aprsd if
"aprsPass yes" is in the aprsd.conf file.
<br>
<p>

The logon format:  <p>

user <call sign> pass <pass code> vers <Program version><p>

eg: user N0CALL pass 00001 vers MacAPRS 3.0<br> 
might be sent by a MacAPRS user. <br>

As pass code of -1 means you are an unregistered user,
not a hacker trying out an bogus password. <p>

You can telent to a port and enter the following,
assuming your Linux user name is bozo and you password is
xyzzy and you are part of the aprs group as defined in
the /etc/group file. <p>

user bozo pass xyzzy <p>

To monitor some server status data you can enter: <p>

user bozo pass xyzzy vers monitor  <p>

The aprs data stream is turned off and "Monitor Mode" is entered.
Once a minute the server will send a status message to you.<p>

Once you have logged on, ctrl-D will not cause a disconnect.
You have to use your Telnet escape key then do a quit.
I had to do this to prevent inadvertant disconnects due to
possible spurious control codes in some users data. <p>

</a>

<a name="abuse">
<h3>
KEEPING ABUSERS OUT OF THE SYSTEM (New in 2.1.0)
</h3>
You can put the call signs of the users you want to
restrict in the users.deny file.  The format is 
the users call sign followed by either
the letter "L" or "R".  The "L" prevents logons and RF access.
The "R" prevents only RF access while allowing the user to
send packets into the aprs network.
<p>
<pre>
user.deny example:

W4EVIL L   <--- Prevents sending of packets into the server or RF
W4SOB R    <--- Prevents any of his packets from getting on RF
		even if they came from another igate.


NOTE: This file is read every time aprsd needs to check users
so you will NOT need to restart the server when you change it.
</pre>
If the abuse becomes serious enough you might consider
putting "aprsPass no" in the aprsd.conf file.  This turns off
the checking of aprs passcodes and only allows Linux user/passwords.
You will need to have all your users in the Linux passwd file.
<hr>

<a name="inet2rf">
<h3>
Full time gating of selected stations from Internet to RF</h3>

For special events or personal reasons it may be desirable
to allow the transfer of packets of selected stations from
the Internet to RF.  Allowing all stations to do this would
overload the 1200 baud VHF packet frequency and isn't allowed.
These packets are only sent on RF if they came from the Internet
and were NOT heard on the local VHF frequency.<p>

There are three "modes" of doing this.  The most permissive
allows all packets from a selected station to be sent to RF
in real time.  The second mode only allows position report packets
to be sent on RF every 14.9 minutes.  This puts much less strain
on the RF network and is the recommended mode.<p>

The third mode which was new in version 2.0.8 gates 3rd party station
to station messages to RF full time if the DESTINATION call sign or alias
is defined in the aprsd.conf file after the msgdest2rf keyword.<p>


You select the stations by entering them in the /home/aprsd2/aprsd.conf file.
Up to 64 stations can be defined. Several can be put on each line.
The server must be restarted before any changes to aprsd.conf take effect. <p>

In version 2.1.5 the "*" wild card character is supported.  Characters
past the "*" will be ignored in the compare operation. For example
W7LUS* would allow all W7LUS ssids to match.

Examples:<br>
<pre>
These stations posits are sent to RF every 15 minutes: 
posit2rf K4HG-8 N4NEQ-9 
posit2rf W7LUS-14

All packets from this station are gated to RF full time.
gate2rf N0CLU-9

Any call with the first 5 characters matching W7LUS will
be gated to RF full time. eg: W7LUS-1 and W7LUS-13.
gate2rf W7LUS*




This allows any message addressed to SCOUTS, KIDS or CQGA to go to
RF even though these "call signs" were not heard locally.
msgdest2rf SCOUTS KIDS CQGA

</pre>


Note: The posits of stations in the "posit2rf" list are sent at 14 second
intervals.  It takes 14.9 minutes to scan the list of 64 before it repeats.
The posits are taken from the 30 minute history list.  If no posit
is available for the station then no data is transmitted.

<a name="NOGATE">
<p>
<h3> NOGATE and RFONLY</h3><P>
Version 2.1.5  adds support for NOGATE and RFONLY in the path.  Any packet from any
source with "NOGATE" or "RFONLY" in its path will be discarded.

<h3>

MIC_E PACKET TRANSLATION </h3>

If you have "ConvertMicE yes" in your aprsd.conf file AND
have set "#define CONVERTMICE TRUE" in the source file
constant.h and recompiled the code, compressed TAPR Mic_E packets are 
converted to standard APRS format
before being sent anywhere else. I used the Mic_E decoder written by
Alan Crosswell, N2YGK to do the conversion. This is the same code that's
in his aprsmon program. <p>
The unconverted raw Mic_E packets from the local TNC 
can be observed by telneting to port 14580.

<a name="aea_tapr">
<h3>AEA to TAPR conversion </h3>

All packets in the AEA format are converted to TAPR format 
before any other processing.  Clients never see an AEA
formatted packet except from the RAW TNC port (14580) if the system
operator is using an AEA TNC. <p>
<hr>
</a>

<a name="PktSource">
<h3>Packet Source path insertions</h3>

To aid in determining where packets were inserted into the APRS
Internet stream, aprsd 2.1.5 appends identifier path elements
at the end of the existing path if not present.
Incoming packets with the "qAc,callsign"   in them are not
modified. <p>

The first added path elemement is a three letter code indicating
data protocol and info about the source of the packet.  This code
can be expanded in the future as needed.<p>


The first character is always "q". The second character is a protocol identifier
for the data payload.  Currently only A=APRS is defined. The third character
is a code that identifies the source of the packet.  The possible codes
are C, X, R, , r, S, U, I, Z. They are defined as follows:<p>

<pre>
Code          Source

C        Validated Client (User). Packet had no q construct.
X        Unvalidated Client
R        RF packet from local TNC or converted from CALLSIGN,I construct
r        Same as above but received indirectly via another server.
S        Server or Hub
U        UDP port on aprsd server
I        Internal status message from aprsd server and Trace Packet
Z        Zero hops and Internal, do not repeat this packet
</pre><p>


Following the qAc path element is the identifier callsign: <p>
<pre>
Source            Identifier

C or X User   Users Login Call sign. 
S APRS Hub    IP address of distant server in HEX. This is the "Hex IP Alias".
I Internal    Server callsign.  (ServerCall in aprsd.conf)
R TNC         IGATE callsign or Callsign preceeding the "I" if converted from CALLSIGN,I .
r             Callsign preceeding the "I"
U UDP         Server callsign.
Z             Server callsign.

</pre>  <p>


Here are some examples.<br>
Assuming MyCall is WA4DSY, ServerCall is aprsdATL, Logged on user is WA4ABC, we are connected to
and receiving data from first.aprs.net and the path does NOT already have 
an qAc, we add: <p>
<pre>
qAC,WA4ABC     from validated internet Client WA4ABC
qAX,WA4ABC     from unvalidated client
qAR,WA4DSY     from local TNC (RF) 
qAR,W4ABC      from logged on client "W4ABC" and converted from W4ABC,I.
qAr,N4ZZ       from a server and converted from N4ZZ,I format.
qAS,C6581502   from Server/Hub third.aprs.net (IP address = 198.88.21.2) (no q and no I )
qAU,aprsdATL   from UDP port
qAI,aprsdATL   from Internal source (server beacon, etc). Packet will be traced.
qAZ,aprsdATL   from Internal source that should not be repeated (server status messages)
</pre>

<p>

If a packet comes in from directly connected client "MYCALL" and already has
a MYCALL,I on the end of the path aprsd 2.1.5 swaps the position of
the "I" and preceeding callsign and changes the I to qAR. 
WA4DSY>APRS,WA4ABC,I:data becomes WA4DSY>APRS,qAR,WA4ABC:data .
<p>
If a packet is received from another server and has MYCALL,I in the
path, the packet is converted to the qAr,MYCALL format.
<p>


The path will be either zero or 2 elements longer than the original.<p> 

If trace is enabled by setting "TRACE YES" in aprsd.conf, all packets passing
through aprsd will have the servers call appended to the end of the AX25 path.

<h3>UDP PORT</h3>

The UDP input port (default 1315) is provided for interface with
scripts.  Only IP addresses listed in the "trust" line(s) in the
aprsd.conf file are can send data to this port.  You can enter
up to 20 trust commands. <p>

Example: <br>
<pre>
trust 198.162.50.5 <p>
</pre>
You may also provide a subnet mask after the ip address
to open up an entire sub net. The example below allows
16 address from 198.162.50.0 to 198.162.50.15 .<p>

Example:<br>
<pre>
trust 198.162.50.0 255.255.255.240 <p>
 </pre>
The script can format packets to be sent to the TNC for RF transmission
or TCPIP.  The routing is determined by the "TO-CALL" field.  If it's
"TNC" the packet goes on on RF via the TNC after the path is striped off. <p>

This goes to the TNC:  WA4DSY>TNC:Data for TNC here <br>
This goes to TCPIP:    WA4DSY>APRS:Data for the Internet <p>

The complete string including the path goes out on the Internet. <p>

</pre>

<p>
Most of the data comes from the aprsd.conf file.<br>
<ul>
<li> MSG_CNT=11 is number of packets sent to RF
<li> LOC_CNT=59 is number of items defined as "LOCAL" in the history buffer
<li> CALL=WA4DSY is from mycall from INIT.TNC
<li> LOCATION=Atlanta_GA is from mylocation
<li> HOST=wa4dsy.net is host name obtained from Linux OS
<li> IP=216.27.174.144 is IP address from Linux OS
<li> EMAIL=sysop@myisp.com is from myemail
<li> VERS=aprsd 2.1.5 is internal version number string.
</ul>

A query from the RF side will not be passed to the Internet
but will be responded to on RF only.  Internet queries will
be passed to other connected servers and will result in replies
from every query enabled IGATE connected to the Internet.

<h3> APRS passcode calculator (new in 2.1.1)</h3>
The aprspass program is located in the /home/aprsd2 directory.
You may move it to another more convienient location if you wish.
To determine the aprs passcode required for a callsign "N0CALL": <br>
Change to the /home/aprsd2 directory.<br>
<pre>
./aprspass N0CALL
APRS passcode for N0CALL = 12345
</pre>
The program will print the passcode "12345".  You may use this 5 digit number
as a password to connect and login to other igates and APRServe.
The callsign and passcode are used as follows in aprsd.conf.
<pre>
igate second.aprs.net 23 N0CALL 12345
</pre>
This causes aprsd to connect the second.aprs.net, port 23.  Data from
that server becomes available at your server.  Your TNC data and logged on
Internet user data is sent to second.aprs.net over the two way connection.
<br>
Please use your <em>real</em> callsign!

<h3>
Monitoring system status with a web browser (new in 2.1.2)
</h3>
System operators can now check the operational status of their
aprsd server with a web browser.  The default port is 14501. To
see the information simply enter the URL into the browser.<br>
Example: To see the Miami server: http://first.aprs.net:14501/<br>
To refresh the data click the browser reload button.  Notice the
igate domain names and user IP addresses are links.  If the host
is running aprsd 212 or later you can click on the link to see
the status of that server.
This is an open port, no passwords are required. <p>
To <em>disable</em> this feature add to your aprsd.conf file: httpport 0

<h3>
Determining the source IP address of aprs packets (new in 2.1.2)
</h3>
  
This TCPIP port (default 14502) supplies all data streams without dup filtering with
a special header prepended. The header contains the source IP address of the
packet and the user login name, "IGATE" or "UDP".  An example: !44.36.16.48:WA4DSY!
Packets from other igates this server connected to will show the domain name
instead of the IP address and the user will be "IGATE".  Packets from the UDP port
will have the IP address and the user field will be "UDP".  Packets from the TNC
will have "TNC" in the IP address field and "*" in the user field .
Use telnet or nc optionally with grep to determine the source of packets.  <br>
eg: telnet first.aprs.net 23 | grep '199.45.66.88' <br>
Will display only packets from IP address 199.45.66.88.<p>
To <em>disable</em> this feature add to your aprsd.conf file: ipwatchport 0

Memory Leak
</h3>

Under RedHat 5.1 this program leaks 8K of memory for each user
connect/disconnect event.  This appears to be a problem with one or more
C libraries in the thread creation/destruction code. 
It has been fixed in 5.2. <p>

To get the fix for 5.1surf over to  
<a href="ftp://ftp.redhat.com/pub/redhat/upgrades/5.1/i386/">
ftp://ftp.redhat.com/pub/redhat/upgrades/5.1/i386/ </a><p>

Then get this file: <br>

glibc-2.0.7-19.i386.rpm <p>

The memory leak seems to be fixed in this version.
To install do:  rpm -U  glibc-2.0.7-19.i386.rpm
then reboot. You don't need to recompile aprsd! <p>
