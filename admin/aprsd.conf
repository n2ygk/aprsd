# Lines starting with "#" are comments and are ignored

#
# Define the radio port to use
# This can either be a serial port with a TNC
# as in /dev/ttyS1, or a Linux AX.25 network interface
# as defined in /etc/ax25/axports. If you use a serial
# device, ensure that you have write permissions. If you
# use Linux sockets, you must run as root (or setuid).
# If undefined all TNC related functions are disabled.

#tncport /dev/ttyS1
#
# Define the baud rate of the serial port. The default is 9600.
# This is ignored if you use a Linux AX.25 device for your tncport.
# Valid speeds are: 300, 1200, 2400, 4800, 9600, 19200, 38400, 57600, 115200.

# This is only used when using Linux sockets, not the TNC.
# For the TNC, set this in INIT.TNC. Note the format is
